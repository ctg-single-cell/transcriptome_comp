## Documents:
    annotation_methods.xlsx
        Excel document containing different scRNAseq annotation methods and gene markers curated from the literature. This is used for the gs_list in the scType processing.
    
    gs_list_FR.xslx
        Excel document containing a list of gene markers for different cell types in the brain based on the literature and scType database which can be used as input in the sctype_annot.R script. 

## Scripts:
    metatdata_annotation.py
        Python script to open and combine raw gene expression and metadata files from Velasco, Polioudakis, and Herring datasets. Then, the data is processed for calculating proportions and subsetted into dataframes to be used for visualization.
       
    sctype_annot.R
         R script to process scRNAseq data with Seurat then annotate cells using the scType tool based on their workflow. The ouput can then be further processed with the python script.
    
    sctype_wrangle.py
        Python script to manipulate dataframes generated by sctype_annot.R (ex: calculate proportions) to use for later visualizations. 
    
    bar_plot.R
        R script to plot cell types based on metadata (metadata_annotation.py) and the scType annotations (output of sctype_annot.R & sctype_processing.py)
    
    cell_typist_annot.py
        Python script to annotate cells based on the Cell Typist reference model: https://github.com/Teichlab/celltypist#usage. The datasets need to be normalized to be used as input for cell typist, so they are first normalized with scanpy.
