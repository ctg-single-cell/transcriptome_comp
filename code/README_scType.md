Documents:
    annotation_methods.xlsx
        Excel document containing different scRNAseq annotation methods and gene markers curated from the literature. This is used for the gs_list in the scType processing.
    
    gs_list_FR.xslx
        Excel document containing a list of gene markers for different cell types in the brain based on the literature and scType database which can be used as input in the sctype_annot.R script. 

Scripts:
   sctype_annot.R
        R script to process scRNAseq data with Seurat then annotate cells using the scType tool based on their workflow. The ouput can then be further processed with the python script.

    sctype_processing.py
        Python script to manipulate dataframes generated by sctype_annot.R (ex: calculate proportions) to use for later visualizations.
